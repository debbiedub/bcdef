These are the design goals.

## A Single Block Chain for Many Uses

The block chain should be a single resource serving many purposes.  It
will allow many applications to store their truths on the chain
without compromising or confusing each-other.

Advocacy: The value grows as the block chain size in the amount of
uses grows.  Splitting into many block chains would make each of them
less valuable and easier to tamper with.

## Separate the Block Chain Mechanisms

Applications communicate via an API with the block chain and the
development of the applications is done in separate projects.

Advocacy: To reduce the size of the project and the plugin to make it
possible to work with and review it is better to keep the applications
out of the mechanisms.

## Run on FreeNet

This is probably the most obvious goal but it is important because it
sets the a lot of restrictions on the design.

FreeNet is run on a set of small/weak nodes with limited network
bandwidth between them, users are setting up and configuring their
nodes individually, nodes can come and go. When a node disappears, we
don't know if it will ever appear again.

## Involve the Community

The development should be done in the full view of the freenet
community.  For a while it is expected that most of the discussions
are on the design and for that a solid design description is needed to
be developed, discussed and improved upon.

Advocacy: Input from the community is needed to do this right.  This
new concept is complicated and getting the correct balance between the
necessities of the block chain to maintain its integrity while not
compromising any user or node on the freenet involve a lot of
complicated design decisions.
