The purpose of having a block chain in freenet is to provide Freenet
with a mechanism that can be used to establish a common truth that is
modifyable.  The typical application for this, that Freenet is sadly
missing, is a wiki, editable by anyone.

A secondary purpose is to provide a way to allow applications to
publish information from many users to many users without the need of
having all users monitor all USKs. Instead all changes are registered
on the block change and each user monitors a small set of USKs to
detect changes on the block chain.  The typical applications for this
could be publishing of trust lists or publishing on a microblog,
functions that are in place today but where we are afraid that the
current solutions will not scale beyond 1000 identities.
