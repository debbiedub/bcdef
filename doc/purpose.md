The purpose of having a block chain in freenet is to provide Freenet
with a mechanism that can be used to establish a common truth that is
modifyable.  The typical application for this is a wiki, editable by
anyone.

A secondary purpose could be to provide a way to allow applications to
publish information from many users to many users without the need of
having all users monitor all USKs. The cost is the maintenance of the
block chain.
