I want to include you, the developers of freenet, in the reasoning of
the development of this function to give you some clues to why I am
doing this, what I am trying to achive
(see [Purpose]({{ site.baseurl }}/purpose/)) and how I progres.

If you have comments or ideas on the work, please send them as:
- Freemail to me (mail address below)
- Sone messages
- Github Pull Requests and comments (if you accept the risks involved on the open internet).

I have been considering how to do this for some time and I think I
have the basic ideas outlined.  This week I set up the framework for
building a fred plugin with gradle and will attempt to start
implementating to see if it is feasable.  There is a risk that the
ideas will not hold or that I will not have the enthusiasm to see this
through but that I will not know if I don't try.

I plan to eventually write down some of the ideas in this site to act
as documentation of the ideas and the implementation.
